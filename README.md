# Design inspiration w/ Dribbble

A micro-site that will help designers formulate projects with prompts and parameters.

## Summary

##### Here, write a paragraph or two describing what you built for your final project and what was challenging. 
I will build a micro-site that will use a database of design prompts and dribbble images to formulate projects for designers.
##### Include a discussion how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.
Users will be able to roll randomly generated prompts that deliver unique project ideas. Users may randomly roll for different projects and possibly individual components of each project.
## Component Parts

From what pieces did you build your project?

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## Challenges
##### A brief discussion of what was hard, challenging, or unexpected about your project.
It will be challenging to implement the dribbble api. I hope it works

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past five weeks?

- Week 1: Write proposal// set up respritory and initial files/workspace
- Week 2: Research API implementation and API experiementation// Setup workspace.// dribble API not functional, dated// Implementing Behance API. // update workspace to acomodate p5 and inserts Behance API.
- Week 3:
- Week 4:
- Week 5: Present!
